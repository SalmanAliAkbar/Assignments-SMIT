<h1>Arttificial Intelligence:</h1><hr>
<p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the development and <i>implementation of computer systems</i> capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence<br><hr>. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, algorithms, and <i>technologies designed</i> to enable machines to perceive, understand, reason, learn, and make decisions similar to humans<br><hr>. AI strives to replicate cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, pattern recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. It involves various subfields, including machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. AI finds applications across diverse domains, from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to medical diagnosis and financial analysis. The ultimate goal of AI is to create intelligent systems that can autonomously adapt, improve, and effectively interact with their environment, ultimately enhancing efficiency, productivity, and innovation across industries.
